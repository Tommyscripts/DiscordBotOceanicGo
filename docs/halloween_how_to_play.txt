How to Play - Halloween Events for Discord
==========================================

1) Night of Mystery (Murder Mystery)
------------------------------------

Overview
--------
Night of Mystery is a social, role-based hidden-identity game for 6–12 players. Each player receives a secret role (Assassin, Detective, Doctor, or Civilian). The game alternates between Night (hidden actions) and Day (open discussion + voting). The goal: Assassins try to eliminate all non-assassins; Civilians and special roles try to find and eject the assassin(s).

Setup
-----
- Channels:
  - #mystery-lobby — public lobby to create and join games.
  - (private) #mystery-<id> — created by the bot for each active game; visible only to participants.
  - DMs — bot sends role info and action prompts.
- Permissions:
  - Bot requires Create/Delete Channels, Manage Roles (optional), Send Messages, and Manage Messages.

Commands (slash)
----------------
- /mm create [min_players:int] [max_players:int]
  - Create a new mystery game lobby. Host auto-joins.
- /mm join
  - Join a lobby.
- /mm leave
  - Leave a lobby (before start).
- /mm start
  - Start the game (host or authorized user).
- /mm action <target>
  - Night action for roles (used via DM or in private channel as needed).
- /mm vote @user
  - Vote to eject a suspect during Day.
- /mm status
  - Show current state, players and round.

Gameplay Flow
-------------
1. Host creates a lobby: /mm create 6 12.
2. Players join: /mm join.
3. When ready, host runs /mm start. Bot:
   - Randomly assigns roles and DMs each player their role and private instructions.
   - Creates private channel #mystery-<id> visible to participants.
4. Night Phase:
   - Bot DMs roles that act at night (Assassin chooses a target with /mm action @target; Doctor can protect a target; Detective may investigate).
   - The bot resolves night actions (kills, saves, investigations).
5. Day Phase:
   - Bot posts a summary (who died, clues).
   - Players discuss in the private channel, then vote with /mm vote @user.
6. Repeat Night → Day until a win condition:
   - Assassins win if they equal or outnumber other players.
   - Civilians win if all assassins are eliminated.
7. Bot announces winners, posts a final summary, and deletes or archives the private channel.

Roles & Basic Rules
-------------------
- Assassin (1–2): Select a target each night. Hidden.
- Detective (1): Investigates one player each night; receives truth/fake clue (tunable).
- Doctor (optional, 1): Protect one player per night (can protect self).
- Civilians: No special night action.

Important Notes
---------------
- All night actions are resolved anonymously by the bot.
- If a player disconnects mid-game, host can choose to continue, auto-pass, or replace the player.
- Keep a record of actions for audit (bot should log them).

Tips for Running
----------------
- Use a time limit for discussion and voting to keep pace.
- If players are new, reveal a short tutorial in lobby.
- To avoid griefing, restrict channel creation to trusted bots and keep logs.

2) Haunted House — Private Channel Adventure
------------------------------------------------------------


Example Walkthrough (Solo)
--------------------------
1. Host /house create solo → bot creates a private channel for the session (e.g. #casa-xxxx).
2. Bot posts intro in channel: “You arrive at the old house. Doors lead north and east.”
3. Player turn:
  - Player types: /house action search
  - Bot replies in channel: “You search the foyer and find an ancient key!”
4. Player uses the key at the locked door: /house action use ancient key on door
5. Bot resolves and reveals next room, possible enemy or puzzle.

Example Walkthrough (Multi)
---------------------------
2. Host creates multi-game: /house create multi 4
2. Host invites players: /house invite @A; players accept via DM with /house accept
3. When all accepted, host runs /house start
4. In-game:
   - Turns rotate between players. Enemies have higher HP and puzzles may need two players activating levers simultaneously.
   - If a player is down (HP ≤ 0), they become incapacitated until revived by a medkit or resuscitation action.

Design Notes & Balancing
------------------------
- Turn timeout: keep it short (15–30s) to keep game flowing; increase for puzzles if needed.
- Loot & risk balance: multi-player should reward cooperation with more loot but scale dangers accordingly.
- Persistent progression: optionally persist player stats (e.g., items or achievements) in a small DB for multi-session campaigns.
- Fair play: log all critical actions (attacks, deaths, puzzle unlocks) to prevent disputes.

Tips for Hosts
--------------
- Announce rules and turn timers in lobby.
- Encourage voice chat for real-time strategy in multi-player games.
- For big servers, create dedicated “events” role so only approved hosts can create game channels.
